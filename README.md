# MRCPP: MultiResolution Computation Program Package

 Documentation: http://mrcpp.readthedocs.io
 
The MultiResolution Computation Program Package (MRCPP) is a general
purpose numerical mathematics library based on multiresolution analysis
and the multiwavelet basis which provide low-scaling algorithms as well
as rigorous error control in numerical computations.

The code is being developed at the Hylleraas Centre for Quantum Molecular
Sciences at UiT - The Arctic University of Norway.
