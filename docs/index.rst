==================================
Welcome to MRCPP's documentation!
==================================

The MultiResolution Computation Program Package (MRCPP) is a general purpose
numerical mathematics library based on multiresolution analysis and the
multiwavelet basis which provide low-scaling algorithms as well as rigorous
error control in numerical computations.

The code is being developed at the `Hylleraas Centre for Quantum Molecular
Sciences <http://www.ctcc.no/>`_ at
`UiT - The Arctic University of Norway <http://en.uit.no>`_.

The code can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/MRChemSoft/mrcpp>`_.
