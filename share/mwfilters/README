The notation used here should be self explaining, it is based on
the notation used in: Alpert, Beylkin, Gines, Vozovoi: 
"Adaptive Solution of Partial Differential Equations in Multiwavelet Bases."

The files: L_MultiWaveletFilters_x.txt, contain the Legendre multiwavelet
filters of order x, while the files I_MultiWaveletFilters_x.txt contain the
interpolating multiwavelet filters of order x.

The files I_H*, I_G*, L_H*, L_G* are the multiwavelet filters, H denotes lowpass
and G denotes highpass, I_* denotes interpolating type and L_* denotes Legendre 
type. L_H0_K denotes the H0 filter of Legendre type with K+1 coefficients. The filters are stored on file according to the indexing convention: H_{ij} = *(H[i]+j),
0 <= i,j <= K in Ansi-C. The L_c_left_K, L_c_right_K denotes the expansion coefficients of the crosscorrelation function of the scaling basis functions of Legendre type and polynomial order K into a Legendre scaling function basis of polynomial order 2K. The coefficients are stored on file according to the indexing convention: c_left_{ijp} = *(c[i][j]+p), 0 <= i,j <= K, 0 <= p <= 2K in Ansi C. Similarly, I_c_left_K denotes the expansion coefficients of crosscorrelation functions of interpolating scaling functions of polynomial order K.
