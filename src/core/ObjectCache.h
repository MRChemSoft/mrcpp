/**
 * @class ObjectCache
 * @tparam T  The object type to be cached (owned via raw pointer).
 *
 * @brief A lightweight, index-addressed cache with singleton access,
 *        optional OpenMP locking, and simple memory accounting.
 *
 * High-level
 * ----------
 * - Stores pointers to objects of type T in a sparse, integer-indexed array.
 * - One global instance per T (Meyers singleton via getInstance()).
 * - Provides virtual hooks `load(id)`, `unload(id)`, `get(id)` for derived
 *   caches to specialize on-demand construction and retrieval.
 * - Tracks approximate memory usage per entry and in total.
 *
 * Thread-safety
 * -------------
 * - The base class initializes an OpenMP lock (if MRCPP_HAS_OMP), and its
 *   destructor clears under that lock. However, *load/get/unload* here are not
 *   automatically locked; derived classes are expected to guard first-time
 *   construction (see FilterCache, ScalingCache, etc.).
 *
 * Ownership & lifetime
 * --------------------
 * - The cache owns stored objects: `unload(id)` deletes them.
 * - `clear()` unloads all present entries.
 * - Copy/assignment are deleted to enforce singleton semantics.
 *
 * Indexing model
 * --------------
 * - `highWaterMark` tracks the largest index ever seen.
 * - Vectors `objs` and `mem` grow to accommodate new ids; gaps are filled with
 *   `nullptr` and `0`. Presence is tested with `hasId(id)`.
 *
 * Memory accounting
 * -----------------
 * - `mem[id]` holds an approximate byte size for entry `id` (provided by the
 *   caller when inserting via `load(id, T*, memory)`).
 * - `memLoaded` sums the sizes of currently loaded entries.
