/** @class DerivativeConvolution
 *
 * @brief Convolution with a derivative kernel
 *
 * @details Derivative operator written as a convolution. The derivative kernel (derivative of
 * Dirac's delta function) is approximated by the derivative of a narrow Gaussian function:
 * \f$ D^x(r-r') = \frac{d}{dx}\delta(r-r') \approx \frac{d}{dx} \alpha e^{-\beta (r-r')^2} \f$
 *
 * NOTE: This is _not_ the recommended derivative operator for practial calculations, it's
 * a proof-of-concept operator. Use the ABGVOperator for "cuspy" functions and the
 * BSOperator for smooth functions.
