/**
 * @file HelmholtzKernel.h
 * @brief Declaration of a Gaussian expansion approximating the 3D Helmholtz (screened Coulomb) kernel.
 *
 * @details
 * This header declares @c HelmholtzKernel, a convenience wrapper that builds a
 * separable Gaussian expansion
 * \f[
 *   K_\mu(r) \;\approx\; \sum_{m=1}^{M} \beta_m\, e^{-\alpha_m r^2},
 * \f]
 * that approximates the radial 3D Helmholtz/Yukawa kernel on a finite interval
 * \f$[r_\min,r_\max]\f$ with a target relative accuracy \f$\varepsilon\f$.
 * The class derives from @ref mrcpp::GaussExp "GaussExp<1>" and therefore can be
 * used anywhere a oneâ€“dimensional Gaussian expansion is expected (e.g. to form
 * convolution operators).

/**
 * @class HelmholtzKernel
 * @brief Gaussian expansion of the 3D Helmholtz (screened Coulomb / Yukawa) kernel.
 *
 * @details
 * Constructs a 1D Gaussian expansion (in the radial variable) by sampling an
 * integral representation of the Helmholtz kernel in a logarithmic parameter and
 * applying a trapezoidal quadrature. The resulting set of Gaussian terms
 * \f$\{\alpha_m,\beta_m\}\f$ is rescaled to the requested physical interval
 * \f$[r_\min,r_\max]\f$.
 *
 * Typical usage:
 * @code
 *   double mu = 1.0;          // screening parameter
 *   double eps = 1e-8;        // target relative accuracy
 *   double rmin = 1e-3, rmax = 10.0;
 *   mrcpp::HelmholtzKernel kernel(mu, eps, rmin, rmax);
 *   // 'kernel' is a GaussExp<1> and can be used to build convolution operators
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note The actual separation rank @f$M@f$ depends on @p epsilon and the interval
 *       size. Extremely tight tolerances or very wide intervals may require a rank
 *       larger than the internal limit (see @c MaxSepRank in the implementation).
