 * @brief Declaration of a 3D separable convolution operator for the Helmholtz/Yukawa kernel.
 *
 * @details
 * This header declares @ref mrcpp::HelmholtzOperator, a specialized
 * @ref ConvolutionOperator that applies the screened Coulomb (Yukawa) Green's function
 * in three spatial dimensions via a Gaussian expansion. The radial kernel
 * \f$ e^{-\mu r}/r \f$ is approximated as a finite sum of 1D Gaussians, enabling
 * separated application across Cartesian coordinates in the MRCPP multiwavelet basis.

 * @brief Separable 3D convolution approximating the Helmholtz (Yukawa) Green's function.
 *
 * @details
 * The continuous kernel
 * \f[
 *   H(\mathbf r - \mathbf r') = \frac{e^{-\mu \lvert \mathbf r - \mathbf r' \rvert}}
 *                                     {\lvert \mathbf r - \mathbf r' \rvert}
 * \f]
 * is approximated by a Gaussian sum
 * \f[
 *   H(\mathbf r - \mathbf r')
 *   \;\approx\;
 *   \sum_{m=1}^{M} \alpha_m \exp\!\big( -\beta_m \lvert \mathbf r - \mathbf r' \rvert^2 \big),
 * \f]
 * which admits a *separable* representation in Cartesian coordinates, allowing the
 * operator to be assembled as a tensor product of 1D convolution blocks within the
 * MRCPP framework. The expansion coefficients \f$ \alpha_m, \beta_m \f$ and the
 * separation rank \f$ M \f$ are chosen internally based on the requested build
 * precision.
 *
 * ### Usage notes
 * - This class is a convenience wrapper that constructs the Gaussian expansion and
 *   the corresponding multiwavelet operator trees; application is handled by the
 *   @ref ConvolutionOperator base.
 * - For periodic worlds and explicit scale control, use the constructor that accepts
 *   @p root and @p reach (see below).
