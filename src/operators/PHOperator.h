/**
 * @file PHOperator.h
 * @brief Declaration of a Holoborodko-style smoothing derivative operator.
 *
 * @details
 * This header declares @ref mrcpp::PHOperator, a lightweight derivative operator
 * constructed from the smooth, low-noise differentiators introduced by
 * Pavel Holoborodko (see
 * <a href="http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/numerical-methods/numerical-derivative/smooth-low-noise-differentiators/">
 * reference link</a>).
 *
 * The operator is assembled in the multiwavelet framework and is intended
 * primarily for experimentation/validation with smoothing differentiators.
 * For robust production work:
 * - use @ref mrcpp::ABGVOperator for functions with cusps/discontinuities,
 * - or @ref mrcpp::BSOperator for sufficiently smooth functions.
 *
 * @see mrcpp::DerivativeOperator, mrcpp::ABGVOperator, mrcpp::BSOperator

 * This class derives from @ref DerivativeOperator and provides a separable,

 * produced by a PH-specific calculator and stored in an @ref OperatorTree.
