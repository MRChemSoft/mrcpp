/**
 * @class PoissonKernel
 * @brief Gaussian expansion of the radial Poisson kernel \f$ 1/r \f$ on a bounded interval.
 *
 * @details
 * Builds a separated, finite Gaussian expansion that approximates the 3D Poisson kernel
 * \f[
 *   \frac{1}{\lvert \mathbf r \rvert} \;\approx\; \sum_{m=1}^{M} \beta_m \, e^{-\alpha_m r^2},
 * \f]
 * valid for radii \f$ r \in [r_{\min},\, r_{\max}] \f$. The coefficients
 * \f$ \{\alpha_m,\beta_m\}_{m=1}^M \f$ are produced by truncating and discretizing
 * (via a trapezoidal rule in logarithmic variables) a continuous representation of
 * \f$ 1/r \f$, with the truncation window and step size chosen to meet a target
 * relative tolerance \p epsilon on the *normalized* interval
 * \f$ [r_{\min}/r_{\max},\,1] \f$ and then rescaled back to \f$ [r_{\min}, r_{\max}] \f$.
 *
 * The resulting object is a one-dimensional @ref GaussExp "GaussExp<1>" whose entries
 * can be used by separable convolution operators to assemble higher-dimensional
 * kernels and operators.
 *
 * @note
 * - Requires \f$ r_{\min} > 0 \f$ and \f$ r_{\max} > r_{\min} \f$.
 * - The number of Gaussian terms \f$ M \f$ is bounded internally (see `MaxSepRank`);
 *   exceeding this bound will abort construction in the implementation.
