/**
 * @file
 * @brief Trivial calculator that clears coefficients and norms on each node.
 *
 * @details
 * Declares @ref mrcpp::DefaultCalculator, a minimal
 * @ref TreeCalculator implementation that:
 *  - iterates over a vector of nodes **sequentially** (no OpenMP),
 *  - for each node, clears coefficient/flag state via
 *    @ref MWNode::clearHasCoefs and resets stored norms via
 *    @ref MWNode::clearNorms.
 *
 * This is useful as a baseline or as a final cleanup pass when no numerical
 * operator needs to be applied but tree state must be normalized.

 * @tparam D Spatial dimension of the tree.
 * @tparam T Scalar coefficient type (`double`, `std::complex<double>`, â€¦).
 *
 * @details
 * The calculator eschews OpenMP parallelism for its node-vector traversal
 * because the work per node is trivial and sequential iteration is typically
 * faster (lower overhead). If parallel traversal is desired, use or derive
 * from an alternative calculator that enables OpenMP in
 * `calcNodeVector`.
