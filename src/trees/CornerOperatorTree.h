/**
 * @file CornerOperatorTree.h
 * @brief Declaration of CornerOperatorTree, a specialization of OperatorTree
 *        for "corner" non-standard form operators.
 *
 * @details
 * Many MRCPP operators are represented in non-standard form and decompose
 * into the four corner submatrices T, A, B, C. This helper class provides:
 * - computation of per-depth band widths for those corner blocks, and
 * - a fast band screen used during operator application.
 *
 * The band width information is stored in a BandWidth object owned by
 * the base class OperatorTree.
 *
 * @par Example
 * @code
 * CornerOperatorTree cot(mra, 10);            // maxDepth = 10
 * cot.calcBandWidth(1e-8);                    // build band widths with a threshold
 * bool within = cot.isOutsideBand(3, 4, 1);   // oTransl=3, o_depth=4, idx=1
 * @endcode
 */

/**
 * @class CornerOperatorTree
 * @brief Operator tree for non-standard form corner matrices.
 *
 * @details
 * This final class only adds band-handling logic on top of @ref OperatorTree.
 * Construction and storage are inherited from the base class; the only
 * public operations exposed here are:
 * - @ref calcBandWidth to build/update the band widths, and
 * - @ref isOutsideBand for a quick test against the stored band.

     *

     * For each depth and for each corner component \f$\{T,A,B,C\}\f$,
     * the routine scans along increasing distance from the diagonal and
     * records the largest translation \f$\ell\f$ for which the component
     * norm still exceeds the threshold. The resulting widths are stored
     * in the underlying @ref BandWidth structure.

     *       widths for the whole tree.

     * to decide whether a sparse block needs to be applied.
