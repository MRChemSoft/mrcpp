/**
 * @file NodeBox.h
 * @brief Container that associates a regular grid of boxes with pointers to MW nodes.
 *
 * @details
 * A NodeBox is a thin wrapper around @ref BoundingBox that, in addition to the
 * geometric information (bounds, scale, periodicity), keeps a dense array of
 * pointers to @ref MWNode objectsâ€”one slot per box at the underlying scale.
 * It is used by @ref MWTree to store and access the set of **root nodes**
 * at the world scale, and by other components whenever a compact mapping
 * from box indices to nodes is required.
